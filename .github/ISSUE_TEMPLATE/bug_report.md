**Share the form input (if applicable)**
1. Navigate to the appropriate demo page corresponding to the version
of ng-formworks that you are using.

    - version 15: https://zahmo.github.io/ng-formworks/15
    - version 16: https://zahmo.github.io/ng-formworks/16
    - version 17: https://zahmo.github.io/ng-formworks/17

    - version 19: https://zahmo.github.io/ng-formworks/19
    - version 20: https://zahmo.github.io/ng-formworks/20
    
2. From the Dropdowns section 'Selected Framework and Options',
    - Select the Framework related to your issue
    - then select the theme(if applicable)
    - check/uncheck any other options(if applicable)

3. If applicable change the Current example.

4. Enter the Form (if part of the issue) into the 'Input JSON Schema and Form Layout' field,
making sure that the JSON data is correctly closed. If all is correct there should be no 'SyntaxError' or similar messages displaying and the 'Generated Form' section
should output a form.
or alternatively 
use the form url field to load form from a url or upload an existing form

5. Populate the Generated Form (if applicable to the issue),
skip this if using a url to load the form.

6. Click the 'Share form URL' button, this should copy the URL of the form to your clipboard (you may have to give the browser permission depending on your OS/Browser).

6. Paste the link in this message.
